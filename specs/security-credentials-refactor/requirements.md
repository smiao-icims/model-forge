# Security Credentials Refactor - Requirements

## Problem Statement
Current implementation stores API keys and authentication credentials in plain text JSON configuration files, creating security vulnerabilities.

## Requirements

### 1. Secure Credential Storage
- **REQ-001**: Store sensitive credentials using system keyring/keychain services
- **REQ-002**: Support multiple credential storage backends (keyring, environment variables, encrypted files)
- **REQ-003**: Provide fallback mechanisms for systems without keyring support
- **REQ-004**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing configuration format

### 2. Credential Lifecycle Management
- **REQ-005**: Secure credential creation with user confirmation
- **REQ-006**: Safe credential retrieval without exposing secrets in logs
- **REQ-007**: Secure credential deletion/removal
- **REQ-008**: Credential rotation support

### 3. Provider-Specific Credential Handling
- **REQ-009**: Support different credential types per provider (API keys, OAuth tokens, certificates)
- **REQ-010**: Handle GitHub Copilot device flow tokens securely
- **REQ-011**: Support Ollama local authentication (no credentials needed)
- **REQ-012**: Support Google service account key files

### 4. User Experience
- **REQ-013**: Provide clear feedback when credentials are stored/retrieved
- **REQ-014**: Maintain CLI compatibility with existing commands
- **REQ-015**: Support non-interactive environments (CI/CD, scripts)

### 5. Security Validation
- **REQ-016**: Validate credential format before storage
- **REQ-017**: Implement credential expiration checking
- **REQ-018**: Provide audit logging for credential operations
- **REQ-019**: Support credential masking in logs and output

### 6. Migration Path
- **REQ-020**: Automatic migration from plain text to secure storage
- **REQ-021**: Provide migration CLI commands
- **REQ-022**: Support rollback to plain text for debugging
- **REQ-023**: Clear migration status reporting

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Zero impact on existing API and public interfaces
- **NFR-002**: Minimal performance overhead for credential operations
- **NFR-003**: Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **NFR-004**: Python 3.11+ compatibility
